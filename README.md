# Image-Processing
# Process || Description 

# 1- Image Color || Converting image to grayscale.  

# 2- Threshold || Function that calculates the threshold of the image based on the average values of pixels.Then, Is the result of this function getting an optimal threshold or not? 
 
# 3- Halftone || Apply simple halftone (threshold).  

# 4- Apply advanced halftone (error diffusion).  

# 5- Histogram || Making a function that gets a histogram of the image. 
## Is the result of this histogram good or not, and why?  
### Apply histogram equalization   

# 6- Simple Edge Detection Methods || 
## Apply sobel operator.  
### Apply prewitt operator.  
#### Apply kirsch compass masks and get the edge direction.  

# 7- Advanced Edge Detection Methods || 
# Apply homogeneity operator.  
## Apply difference operator.  
### Apply difference of gaussians using 7*7 and 9*9 masks
#### Apply contrast-based edge detection using smoothing mask  
##### Apply variance  
##### Apply range.  

# 8- Filtering ||
## Apply a high-pass filter.  
### Apply a low-pass filter.  
#### Apply median filter.  

# 9- Image Operations || 
## Make a copy of the image and add the image and its copy.  
### Make a copy of the image and subtract the image and its copy.  
#### Invert the image.  

# 10- Histogram Based Segmentaion || 
## Apply manual technique.  
### Apply histogram peak technique.  
#### Apply histogram valley technique.  
##### Apply adaptive histogram technique.
